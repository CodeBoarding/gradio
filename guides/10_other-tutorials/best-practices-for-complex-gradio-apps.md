# Best Practices for Complex Gradio Applications

As your Gradio applications grow in complexity, it becomes important to follow software engineering best practices to keep your code maintainable and scalable. This guide covers key principles and patterns for building complex Gradio apps, using as an example, a `Book Illustrator` Gradio app that lets you write and illustrate a children's book using AI. 

## Separation of Concerns

One of the most important principles when building complex applications is separating different aspects of your code into logical components. Here's how you can apply this to Gradio apps.

### 1. Separate Model Logic from Interface Code

Instead of mixing your model inference code with your Gradio interface code, separate them:

1. Separation of concerns
Modular design patterns
State management
Performance optimization
Error handling
Testing
Multi-page application structure
